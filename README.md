# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page

This is my solution to Frontend Mentor's [Base Apparel coming soon page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0). The challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. ðŸ‘‹

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to create this QR code component:
- HTML
- CSS
- React w/TypesScript


## My Process

Most of the work was in matching the mobile and desktop design files, depending on the media size. This was primary done with CSS.
The CSS file, App.css, is messy and would normally be refactored, but for this exercise I can't be bothered.

The state changes for validating the email address and the mouse up/down events were done with React's useState.


## Credits

I would like to thank Frontend Mentor for providing this challenge, as it allowed me to practice my frontend development skills.
